Building instructions for Scintilla (specific to Analysis Manager).

1. Open the project in Visual Studio, using the project or solution file in win32/
2. Build the x86 and x64 Release version of the DLL.  The easiest way to do this is using Build -> Batch Build
3. The project is set up to use a custom post-build script (win32/deploy.bat).  This copies the output to the ScintillaNET folders as needed for that build.  Make sure this passes and the DLL is updated appropriatelly.
